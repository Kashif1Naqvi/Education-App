      <br/>
      <p>
        When JavaScript was created, it initially had another name: <b>“LiveScript”</b>.
        But Java language was very popular at that time, so it was decided that positioning a new language as a “younger brother” of Java would help.
        But as it evolved, JavaScript became a fully independent language, with its 
        own specification called <b>ECMAScript</b>, and now it has no relation to Java at all.
      </p>
      <br/>
