                        <p>What Is Big Data? (2:32)</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>To really understand big data, it&rsquo;s helpful to have some historical background. Here&rsquo;s Gartner&rsquo;s definition, circa 2001 (which is still the go-to definition): Big data is data that contains greater variety arriving in increasing volumes and with ever-higher velocity. This is known as the three Vs.</p>
                    <p>Put simply, big data is larger, more complex data sets, especially from new data sources. These data sets are so voluminous that traditional data processing software just can&rsquo;t manage them. But these massive volumes of data can be used to address business problems you wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to tackle before.</p>

                            <h4 className="cmps-nhead">Volume</h4>
                            <p>The amount of data matters. With big data, you&rsquo;ll have to process high volumes of low-density, unstructured data. This can be data of unknown value, such as Twitter data feeds, clickstreams on a webpage or a mobile app, or sensor-enabled equipment. For some organizations, this might be tens of terabytes of data. For others, it may be hundreds of petabytes.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div className="cmps-nitem">
                            <h4 className="cmps-nhead">Velocity</h4>
                            <p>Velocity is the fast rate at which data is received and (perhaps) acted on. Normally, the highest velocity of data streams directly into memory versus being written to disk. Some internet-enabled smart products operate in real time or near real time and will require real-time evaluation and action. </p>

                            <h4 className="cmps-nhead">Variety</h4>
                            <p>Variety refers to the many types of data that are available. Traditional data types were structured and fit neatly in a relational database. With the rise of big data, data comes in new unstructured data types. Unstructured and semistructured data types, such as text, audio, and video require additional preprocessing to derive meaning and support metadata.</p>

                    <p>Two more Vs have emerged over the past few years: 
                        <strong>value</strong> and
                        <strong>veracity</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p>Data has intrinsic value. But it&rsquo;s of no use until that value is discovered. Equally important: How truthful is your data&mdash;and how much can you rely on it?</p>
                    <p>Today, big data has become capital. Think of some of the world&rsquo;s biggest tech companies. A large part of the value they offer comes from their data, which they&rsquo;re constantly analyzing to produce more efficiency and develop new products.</p>
                    <p>Recent technological breakthroughs have exponentially reduced the cost of data storage and compute, making it easier and less expensive to store more data than ever before. With an increased volume of big data now cheaper and more accessible, you can make more accurate and precise business decisions.</p>
                    <p>Finding value in big data isn&rsquo;t only about analyzing it (which is a whole other benefit). It&rsquo;s an entire discovery process that requires insightful analysts, business users, and executives who ask the right questions, recognize patterns, make informed assumptions, and predict behavior.</p>
                    <p>But how did we get here?</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Although the concept of big data itself is relatively new, the origins of large data sets go back to the 1960s and &#39;70s when the world of data was just getting started, with the first data centers and the development of the relational database.</p>
                    <p>Around 2005, people began to realize just how much data users generated through Facebook, YouTube, and other online services. Hadoop (an open-source framework created specifically to store and analyze big data sets) was developed that same year. NoSQL also began to gain popularity during this time.</p>
                    <p>The development of open-source frameworks, such as Hadoop (and more recently, Spark) was essential for the growth of big data because they make big data easier to work with and cheaper to store. In the years since then, the volume of big data has skyrocketed. Users are still generating huge amounts of data&mdash;but it&rsquo;s not just humans who are doing it.</p>
                    <p>With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) , more objects and devices are connected to the internet, gathering data on customer usage patterns and product performance. The emergence of machine learning has produced still more data.</p>
                    <p>While big data has come far, its usefulness is only just beginning. Cloud computing has expanded big data possibilities even further. The cloud offers truly elastic scalability, where developers can simply spin up ad hoc clusters to test a subset of data.</p>

                        <strong>Product Development </strong>
                        <br />
                          Companies like Netflix and Procter &amp; Gamble use big data to anticipate customer demand. They build predictive models for new products and services by classifying key attributes of past and current products or services and modeling the relationship between those attributes and the commercial success of the offerings. In addition, P&amp;G uses data and analytics from focus groups, social media, test markets, and early store rollouts to plan, produce, and launch new products.

                        <strong>Predictive Maintenance </strong>
                        <br />
                            Factors that can predict mechanical failures may be deeply buried in structured data, such as the equipment year, make, and model of a machine, as well as in unstructured data that covers millions of log entries, sensor data, error messages, and engine temperature. By analyzing these indications of potential issues before the problems happen, organizations can deploy maintenance more cost effectively and maximize parts and equipment uptime.

                        </a>. Organizations still struggle to keep pace with their data and find ways to effectively store it.
                    </p>
                    <p>But it&rsquo;s not enough to just store the data. Data must be used to be valuable and that depends on curation. Clean data, or data that&rsquo;s relevant to the client and organized in a way that enables meaningful analysis, requires a lot of work. Data scientists spend 
                        <a target="blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/technology/for-big-data-scientists-hurdle-to-insights-is-janitor-work.html" >50 to 80 percent of their time</a> curating and preparing data before it can actually be used.
                    </p>
                    <p>Finally, big data technology is changing at a rapid pace. A few years ago, Apache Hadoop was the popular technology used to handle big data. Then Apache Spark was introduced in 2014. Today, a combination of the two frameworks appears to be the best approach. Keeping up with big data technology is an ongoing challenge.</p>
