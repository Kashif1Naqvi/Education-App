      <p>Since the invention of computers or machines, their capability to perform various tasks went on growing exponentially. Humans have developed the power of computer systems in terms of their diverse working domains, their increasing speed, and reducing size with respect to time.</p>
                                    <p>A branch of Computer Science named 
                                        <i>Artificial Intelligence</i> pursues creating the computers or machines as intelligent as human beings.

                                    <h2>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h2>
                                    <p>According to the father of Artificial Intelligence, John McCarthy, it is 
                                        <i>“The science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs”.</i>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Artificial Intelligence is a way of 
                                        <b>making a computer, a computer-controlled robot, or a software think intelligently</b>, in the similar manner the intelligent humans think.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>AI is accomplished by studying how human brain thinks, and how humans learn, decide, and work while trying to solve a problem, and then using the outcomes of this study as a basis of developing intelligent software and systems.</p>
                                    <h2>Philosophy of AI</h2>
                                    <p>While exploiting the power of the computer systems, the curiosity of human, lead him to wonder, 
                                        <i>“Can a machine think and behave like humans do?”</i>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Thus, the development of AI started with the intention of creating similar intelligence in machines that we find and regard high in humans.</p>
                                    
                                    <h2>What Contributes to AI?</h2>
                                    <p>Artificial intelligence is a science and technology based on disciplines such as Computer Science, Biology, Psychology, Linguistics, Mathematics, and Engineering. A major thrust of AI is in the development of computer functions associated with human intelligence, such as reasoning, learning, and problem solving.</p>
                                    <p>Out of the following areas, one or multiple areas can contribute to build an intelligent system.</p>
