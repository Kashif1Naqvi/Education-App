                                                            <p>With the evolution in the Internet, the ways how businesses, economies, stock markets even how the governments function and operate has also evolved, big time. It has also changed the way people live, for crying out loud. With all of this happening, there has been an observable rise in all the information floating around these days, it’s more than ever before. This outburst of data is relatively new. Before the past couple of years  most of the data was stored on paper, film or any other analogue media, only one quarter of all the world&#8217;s stored information was digital. But with the exponential increase in data, the idea of storing it manually just does not hold any appeal.</p>
